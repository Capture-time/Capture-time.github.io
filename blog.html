                                    Use the Closeup scene mode or Macro mode. These modes allow the camera to focus on objects that are only a few inches away.
Watch the auto-focus. 
Once the camera focuses, don't move it. 
Avoid using flash. 
Try shooting in cloudy weather

                                    We all love to admire landscapes and cityscapes. The moment we witness the beauty of nature we instantly take out our camera and start clicking photos.
